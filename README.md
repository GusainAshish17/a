# Identify the INDIAN classical dance form
Classifying 8 different dance forms using transfer learning, while utilizing pre-trained model ResNet50.


## Problem statement
```
This International Dance Day, an event management company organized an evening of Indian classical dance 
performances to celebrate the rich, eloquent, and elegant art of dance. 
The task is to build a deep learning model that can help the company classify these images into 
eight categories of Indian classical dance.
```
The eight categories of Indian classical dance are as follows:
* **Manipuri**
* **Bharatanatyam**
* **Odissi**
* **Kathakali**
* **Kathak**
* **Sattriya**
* **Kuchipudi**
* **Mohiniyattam**





## Data Description
This data set consists of the following two columns:

Column Name | Description
------------- | -------------
Image  | Name of Image
Target  | 	Category of Image ['manipuri','bharatanatyam','odissi','kathakali','kathak','sattriya','kuchipudi','mohiniyattam']

The data folder consists of two folders and two .csv files. The details are as follows:
* **train** : Contains 364 images for 8 classes ['manipuri','bharatanatyam','odissi','kathakali','kathak','sattriya','kuchipudi','mohiniyattam']
* **test**: Contains 156 images
* **train.csv**: 364 x 2
* **test.csv**: 156 x 1
