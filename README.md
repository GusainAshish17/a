# Identify the INDIAN classical dance form
Classifying 8 different dance forms using transfer learning, while utilizing pre-trained model ResNet50.

## Problem statement

```
This International Dance Day, an event management company organized an evening of Indian classical dance 
performances to celebrate the rich, eloquent, and elegant art of dance. After the event, the company 
plans to create a microsite to promote and raise awareness among people about these dance forms. 
However, identifying them from images is a difficult task.

You are appointed as a Machine Learning Engineer for this project. Your task is to build a deep learning 
model that can help the company classify these images into eight categories of Indian classical dance.
```

## Note
```
The eight categories of Indian classical dance are as follows:
Manipuri
Bharatanatyam
Odissi
Kathakali
Kathak
Sattriya
Kuchipudi
Mohiniyattam
```
